Very Easy to setup.

Need to add CSS and JS

JavaScript and CSS library

work with and build on HTML5 video

also known as an HTML5 Video Player.

common controls skin built in HTML/CSS

fixes cross-browser inconsistencies

features like fullscreen and subtitles

allback to Flash or other playback technologies

consistent JavaScript API for interacting with the video.

HTML is the markup language that makes up every page on the web. The newest version, HTML5, includes specifications for a <video> tag, that's meant to allow web developers to add a video to a page in the same way they would add an image. In order for this to work, web browser developers have built video playback functionality into their browsers.

standardizing video playback across web browsers 

one method for embedding a video

as well as providing one consistent JavaScript API for both HTML5, Flash, and other playback technologies.

but Video.js includes an 'HTML5 Shiv', which needs to be in the head for older IE versions to respect the video tag as a valid element.

Easy to import
<link href="//vjs.zencdn.net/4.10/video-js.css" rel="stylesheet">
<script src="//vjs.zencdn.net/4.10/video.js"></script>

Add an HTML5 video tag to your page.

With Video.js you just use an HTML5 video tag to embed a video. Video.js will then read the tag and make it work in all browsers, not just ones that support HTML5 video. Beyond the basic markup, Video.js needs a few extra pieces.

'data-setup' Attribute tells Video.js to automatically set up the video when the page is ready
can read data in JSON format

give class, data-setup, id

data-setup='{"example_option":true}' 
class="video-js vjs-default-skin"
id="myVideoPlayer"

big play button is located in the upper left hand corner
vjs-big-play-centered - to make it centered

video-js -- To initialize the library,
vjs-default-skin -- To initialize the skins over video tag
