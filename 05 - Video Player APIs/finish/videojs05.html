<!--

What if you want to access Video or HTML5 Media APIs using javascript.

get the video player object assigned in a variable.

Rest of APIs are accessible and are same as HTML5 Media API.
https://github.com/videojs/video.js/blob/stable/docs/api/vjs.Player.md
https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/embedded-content.html#the-video-element


Media APIs are really helpful to reduce memory footprint and take advantage in complex business logics.

Lots of events
durationchange EVENT

Fired when the duration of the media resource is first known or changed
defined in: src/js/player.js#L554

ended EVENT

Fired when the end of the media resource is reached (currentTime == duration)
defined in: src/js/player.js#L541

firstplay EVENT

Fired the first time a video is played

Not part of the HLS spec, and we're not sure if this is the best implementation yet, so use sparingly. If you don't have a reason to prevent playback, use myPlayer.one('play'); instead.
defined in: src/js/player.js#L498

fullscreenchange EVENT

Fired when the player switches in or out of fullscreen mode
defined in: src/js/player.js#L583

loadedalldata EVENT

Fired when the player has finished downloading the source data
defined in: src/js/player.js#L445

loadeddata EVENT

Fired when the player has downloaded data at the current playback position
defined in: src/js/player.js#L439

loadedmetadata EVENT

Fired when the player has initial duration and dimension information
defined in: src/js/player.js#L433

loadstart EVENT

Fired when the user agent begins looking for media data
defined in: src/js/player.js#L389

pause EVENT

Fired whenever the media has been paused
defined in: src/js/player.js#L512

play EVENT

Fired whenever the media begins or resumes playback
defined in: src/js/player.js#L451

progress EVENT

Fired while the user agent is downloading media data
defined in: src/js/player.js#L530

resize EVENT

Fired when the width and/or height of the component changes
inherited from: src/js/component.js#L1020

seeked EVENT

Fired when the player has finished jumping to a new time
defined in: src/js/player.js#L485

seeking EVENT

Fired whenever the player is jumping to a new time
defined in: src/js/player.js#L477

timeupdate EVENT

Fired when the current playback position has changed

During playback this is fired every 15-250 milliseconds, depending on the playback technology in use.
defined in: src/js/player.js#L524

volumechange EVENT

Fired when the volume changes
defined in: src/js/player.js#L577

Fired whenever the media begins waiting
defined in: src/js/player.js#L460
